This file should contain the function that selects the correct function to perform the operation asked by the user. You’re not allowed to declare any other function.

Prototype: int (*get_op_func(char *s))(int, int);
where s is the operator passed as argument to the program
This function returns a pointer to the function that corresponds to the operator given as a parameter. Example: get_op_func("+") should return a pointer to the function op_add
You are not allowed to use switch statements
You are not allowed to use for or do ... while loops
You are not allowed to use goto
You are not allowed to use else
You are not allowed to use more than one if statement in your code
You are not allowed to use more than one while loop in your code
If s does not match any of the 5 expected operators (+, -, *, /, %), return NULL
You are only allowed to declare these two variables in this function:
    op_t ops[] = {
        {"+", op_add},
        {"-", op_sub},
        {"*", op_mul},
        {"/", op_div},
        {"%", op_mod},
        {NULL, NULL}
