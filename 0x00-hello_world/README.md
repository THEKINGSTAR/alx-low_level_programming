# **C - Hello, World**
![alt text](https://github.com/THEKINGSTAR/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/c.jpg?raw=true)

## General

* Why C programming is awesome (don’t forget to tweet today, with the hashtag #cisfun :))
* Who invented C
* Who are Dennis Ritchie, Brian Kernighan and Linus Torvalds
* What happens when you type gcc main.c
* What is an entry point
* What is main
* How to print text using printf, puts and putchar
* How to get the size of a specific type using the unary operator sizeof
* How to compile using gcc
* What is the default program name when compiling with gcc
* What is the official Holberton C coding style and how to check your code with betty-style
* How to find the right header to include in your source code when using a standard library function
* How does the main function influence the return value of the program

## Requirements C

* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using gcc 4.8.4
* All your files should end with a new line
* A README.md file at the root of the holbertonschool-low_level_programming repo, containing a description of the repository
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of this project, containing a description of the project
* There should be no errors and no warnings during compilation
* You are not allowed to use system
* Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl

## 0-preprocessor: Preprocessor

* A script that runs a *C* file through the preprocessor and save the result into another file. The C file name will be saved in the variable *$CFILE*
* The output should be saved in the file *c* using: ```c *gcc $CFILE -E -o c*```.

## 1-compiler: Compiler

* A script that compiles a C file but does not link. The *C* file name will be saved in the variable *$CFILE*
* The output file should be named the same as the *C* file, but with the extension *.o* instead of *.c*

*Example:* if the C file is *main.c*, the output file should be *main.o* using ```c *gcc -c $CFILE* ```.

## 2-assembler: Assembler

* A script that generates the assembly code of a *C* code and save it in an output file. The *C* file name will be saved in the variable *$CFILE*
* The output file should be named the same as the *C* file, but with the extension *.s* instead of *.c*.

*Example:* if the *C* file is *main.c*, the output file should be *main.s* using ```c *gcc -S $CFILE* ```.

## 3-name: Name

* A script that compiles a *C* file and creates an executable named *cisfun*. The *C* file name will be saved in the variable *$CFILE* using ```c *gcc $CFILE -o cisfun*```.

## 4-puts.c: Hello, puts

* A *C* program that prints exactly *"Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle, followed by a new line.*. Use the function *puts*
* You are not allowed to use *printf*; Your program should end with the value *0* using:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
        puts("Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle\n");
        return (0);
}
```
## 5-printf.c: Hello, printf

* A *C* program that prints exactly *with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art,*, followed by a new line. Use the function *printf*
* You are not allowed to use the function *puts*
* Your program should return *0*
* Your program should compile without warning when using the ``` *-Wall gcc* ``` option using:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
        printf("with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art,\n");
        return (0);
}
```

## 6-size.c: Size is not grandeur, and territory does not make a nation

* A *C* program that prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled and run on. You should produce the exact same output as in the example 
* Warnings are allowed; Your program should return *0*
* You might have to install the package *libc6-dev-i386* on your Linux (Vagrant) to test the ``` *-m32 gcc* ``` option using:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
        int a;
        long int b;
        long long int c;
        char d;
        float f;

        printf("Size of a char: %lu byte(s)\n", (unsigned long)sizeof(d));
        printf("Size of an int: %lu byte(s)\n", (unsigned long)sizeof(a));
        printf("Size of a long int: %lu byte(s)\n", (unsigned long)sizeof(b));
        printf("Size of a long long int: %lu byte(s)\n", (unsigned long)sizeof(c));
        printf("Size of a float: %lu byte(s)\n", (unsigned long)sizeof(f));
        return (0);
}
```

## 100-intel: Intel

A script that generates the assembly code (Intel syntax) of a *C* code and save it in an output file. The *C* file name will be saved in the variable *$CFILE*. The output file should be named the same as the *C* file, but with the extension *.s* instead of *.c*.

*Example:* if the *C* file is *main.c*, the output file should be *main.s*  USING *gcc -S*

 ```c
gcc -S -masm=intel $CFILE
```

## 101-quote.c: 
* UNIX is basically a simple operating system, but you have to be a genius to understand the simplicity

* A *C* program that prints exactly *and that piece of art is useful" - Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19*, followed by a new line, to the standard error. You are not allowed to use any functions listed in the *NAME* section of the *man (3) printf or man (3) puts*
* Your program should return *1*
* Your program should compile without any warnings when using the *-Wall gcc* option using:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
        write(2, "and that piece of art is useful\" - Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19\n", 61);

        return (1);
}
```
them into account). 
* We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
* The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called main.h
* Don’t forget to push your header file

### You do not need to learn about pointers to functions, arrays of structures, malloc and free - yet.
